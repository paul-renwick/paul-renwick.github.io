        <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
        <p>This is a pretty huge question, one which I can barely skim the surface of for the purpose of this blog. I suppose I should start by acknowledging my fortune of being raised as a middle-upper class, heterosexual, white male. I have never been a part of a minority in New Zealand, and as such, I have never really experienced racism, sexism or classism. In saying that, I left home when I was 18 and lived abroad for 7 years, trying not to lean too hard on the wealth of my parents. I was raised in a very Christian household which would come to shape my values and identity greatly in my older years. When I was a teenager I began to question my faith and came to reject Christian morals, values and beliefs. Much like a pendulum that was pulled far in one direction, my values have swung to being embedded in an Atheistic Existentialism in which all values are not embedded in anything external or objective, but rather, are created by us. Since morality has no objective value, what is right and wrong is primarily what is liked and disliked, a consequence of our emotions. In accordance with this my values align mostly with what I think would make others happy, a type of utilitarianism. I also highly value independent thought and an ability to question traditional conventions. </p>
        <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h5>
        <p>I feel as though my decision to stop my previous career as a behavioural therapist had a large ethical component. On one side, my job involved helping children with autism develop life skills, something that most people would deem to be a good thing, on the other side, I had become exhausted, tired and fed up with the role. If I was to continue my performance would have diminished, a consequence of my time in the field, as such, I was able to rationalise that the best thing to do for my clients was to allow them access to an alternative therapist, someone who had not reached the same position I was in.  The consequences of my decision were that I now lead a life that I am more engaged in and hopefully my ex-clients are receiving the therapy they deserve.</p>
        <h5>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h5>
        <p>Given my history of studying within a tertiary education environment, I feel as though I am well equipped to handle the stresses associated with study. The up skilling of my organisational skills from the first component of this course have certainly made me feel even more capable when it comes to staying on task and getting things done. I feel as though my focus has been a strength so far and the fruits of my study are their own reward, it is really rewarding finishing the day with another skill. </p>
        <p>Limitations wise, I think that I will need to make sure I have the confidence I feel now when I complete the bootcamp. Currently I feel like I am doing really well and if I could keep up this positivity I feel it will serve me well in finding employment opportunities. </p>
        <h5>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h5>
        <p>Because I feel like I am highly motivated by completion (I feel weird if I can’t finish a plate of food, and won’t accept others till I’ve finished my own), this motivator will serve me well in digging deep on projects and knuckling down. This may however result in frustration on my behalf if there is an obstacle that I am unable to overcome in order to complete a task. </p>
        <h5>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h5>
        <p>Last weekend me and my girlfriend got a washing machine for our place. We both managed to work together to get it into the back of my car, but, I had just done leg day at the gym a day prior and I was walking like bambi. When we got to our house me and my girlfriend had a discussion about how the best way was going to be to get it up the stairs and into the house. We both reasoned that it was best if we left the washing machine in the car till the following day when hopefully some strength had been restored. (Good, discussing the problem at hand and coming up with a reasonable solution) When it came to the following day, we both attempted to get it up the stairs but due to my girlfriends poor back and my still noodle-like legs it turned out to be quite a difficult task. The solution we ended up stumbling upon was me lifting it up the stairs by myself in great agony (Bad, was not pleasant damaged stairs). We ended up getting it into the washing room after much sweat and many expletives; however, in retrospect perhaps it would have been better to ask my somewhat burly neighbour if he was able to give me a hand rather than fatiguing myself and scuffing up some stairs. My girlfriend wants me to add that she then cleaned the washing machine. </p>
