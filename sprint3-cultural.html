        <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence refers to our ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions as well as influence the emotions of others. Fundamentally, it is an understanding of the **affect** (emphasizes on affect rather than effect) that our behaviours have on ourselves and others. It is fundamentally important to how we interact with others and can be a major predictor of social and professional success. Emotional Intelligence differs from IQ in that while IQ deals with logical capabilities, higher order thinking, spatial processing and other classically intellectual processes, EQ refers to how well we can identify emotions, evaluate how others feel, control our own emotions, relate to others and communicate using emotions. </p>
        <p>Perhaps one way to illustrate how EQ is important is if we use a thought experiment to illustrate what it would be like if a person had a very very low EQ and a very very high IQ. An individual with those traits would be perceived to be more akin to a robot than a social human. They may be able to perform as an excellent programmer, they could solve problems rationally however they would struggle to function within a workplace as they would not have the repertoire of skills to navigate the complex jungle of human interactions. Similarly, if an individual had very high EQ but very low IQ, they might be able to empathize with others, read their emotions and understand how they feel, but without the ability to solve logic oriented problems or fix code, they might not be the most useful employee. In this sense both IQ and EQ are important to being a well-rounded and successful individual.  </p>
