// PSEUDO CODE 

// STEPS TO DO:
// Create the calculator in HTML, begin by assigning the calculator space within a column
// Start creating containers for all of the elements within the calculator
// A row for the top space
// A row for the display
// a row containing AC, CE, & and divideby
// A row containing 7 8 9 x
// a row containing 4 5 6 -
// a row containing 1 2 3 +
// a row containing 0 . =

// After i've set up the basic container and rows/cols for the calculator, proceed to start bilding the css, 
// asign the calculator width, height and color, 
// assign font for any title i choose to have on the calculator
// asign css properties to the display box, the size of it, the color, font border etc
// assign properties for the buttons, can start as all one colour but might be nice to give the ac and ce buttons different colours, also maybe the non- number buttons

// following this move on to the javascript itself
