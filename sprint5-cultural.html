        <h4>Final Foundations Core Reflections</h4>
            <h5>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h5>
            <p>I honestly don’t think that here been any shocking revelations of or new discoveries from the core component of foundations. Coming from a Psychology background and having worked as a therapist for 6 years, I feel that I’ve done a lot of these types of activities before. If anything it served as a refresher for those ideas and skills which I have learned in the past. </p>
            <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
            <p>My complete inability to concentrate during the headspace activities after my second coffee.</p>
            <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
            <p>Probably the identity and values exploration, the reflection part was easy enough but conveying it in a way to share with others was more difficult. </p>
            <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development boot camp course?</h5>
            <p>There might be a lot of jobs out there but there are also a lot of fledging developers looking to get a piece of that pie. If an employer encounters two candidates with equivalent skills then the deciding factor is going to be how well the employer thinks that each candidate will fit within the company. Our people skills are the things which help us become better fits. Being able to play as part of a team, listen and function under pressure are all skills that help us to increase our chances of success. </p>
            <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h5>
            <p>I can see why it was done. I preferred the programming elements of the course, the core elements served as mini breaks for me. I think that if a student puts a lot into the core exercises and really absorbs the meaning behind them, then yeah, the core is great for that type of student. But if you go into them with a somewhat cynical or skeptical outlook then you’re probably not going to benefit as much.  </p>
