        <h4>Technical Blog 4:</h4>
        <p>I got blocked a lot this sprint.  It was pretty smooth sailing till I got to the issue of returning an Array for super fizzbuzz. I checked on the solution and didn’t understand .map. I had to do a lot of research regarding what it was and how it should be used, but then when I researched .map I would discover that I would then need to understand arrow functions. I ended up going down a rabbit hole of how to code more elegantly in javascript. I would say that I have a very shallow understanding of some of the higher order methods, I most certainly need to keep working and understanding things like the arrow function, .reduce, .map and .find. </p>
        <p>I was quite happy when I managed to solve the .sum method problem without consulting the answers. I primarily used my main man google and then hit up youtube where I was able to find a video tutorial on some higher order methods. I felt pretty disappointed with myself at first as I was really struggling to avoid distractions, but, once I managed to watch the entire video it wasn’t difficult to apply what I’d learnt and solve the .sum kata.</p>
        <h5>Problem Solving Techniques:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode – I need to make an effort to use this more actively, I found that when I was able to actually solve an issue that I was stuck on for a while it was because I went back and wrote out what I was trying to do.</li>
          <li>Trying something – I am often just mashing in random bits of code crossing my fingers and then scratching my head</li>
          <li>Rubber ducky method – I have a little blue mecha man that my friend sent me from Japan. He has become my sounding board for all things tech related. He is also becoming a part time therapist.</li>
          <li>Reading error messages – Definitely helps a lot, I still frequently run into an issue where I’ve added an additional ‘}’ or I’m missing a ; or I’ve spelt a variable wrong.</li>
          <li>Console.logging – Not using this enough, will need to implement it more.</li>
          <li>Googling – Google is my home boy, we’ve been tight since my Uni days many moons ago and we continue to be absolute bros.</li>
          <li>Asking your peers for help – Less actively using this, I’ve posted some questions in the foundations channel, although I think that a lot of my current issue stem from me still getting together my basics. I’d rather make sure my basics are up to scratch before I pester fellow peers.</li>
          <li>Asking coaches for help – Don’t mind bugging coaches so much. I went in to get some coding help from Allie on Wednesday which I found super useful. Would recommend to anyone else trying to wrap their head around coding issues.</li>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection – This is definitely helpful, continual reflection and thoughts on the operations of JavaScript and things that I’ve learnt throughout the day are helping me consolidate my thoughts and understanding.</li>
